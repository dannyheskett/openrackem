# openrackem — Google Play store listing

Copy/paste these into the Play Console (**Grow → Store presence → Main store
listing**, plus **Store settings** for category). The images in this folder are
the shipped assets — they were generated once and are now committed artifacts.
The generator was removed after the assets landed; recover it from history
(`git log -- scripts/gen_play_assets.py`) if they ever need regenerating.

Stack falling blocks, clear lines, and chase higher levels in a clean, classic block puzzle — with none of the junk that clutters this genre.

No ads. No tracking. No accounts. No in-app purchases. openrackem requests zero permissions and never touches the network. It's just the game.

PURE CLASSIC GAMEPLAY
• Clear lines to score and level up, with gravity that ramps up as you go
• Plan ahead with the next-piece preview
• Soft drop for control, hard drop for speed
• Wall kicks for smooth, forgiving rotation
• Pause anytime and pick up where you left off

BUILT RIGHT
• Large on-screen buttons tuned for one-handed play
• Crisp, minimal visuals that stay out of your way
• Fully offline — perfect for flights, commutes, anywhere
• Tiny download, easy on your battery

FREE AND OPEN SOURCE
openrackem is open source. Read the code, report a bug, or build it yourself: https://github.com/dannyheskett/openrackem

No dark patterns, no "energy" timers, no paywalled pieces. Just the timeless falling-block puzzle, done properly.
